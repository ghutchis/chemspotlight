ChemSpotlight 1.1   README
--------------------------

ChemSpotlight is a Spotlight metadata importer plugin for Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, which reads common chemical file formats (MDL .mol, .mdl, .sd, .sdf, Tripos .mol2, PDB, Chemical Markup Language, XYZ) using the Open Babel chemistry library. It is provided as a Universal Binary for PowerPC and Intel, for optimized performance on both.

This XCode project was created using XCode 2.4 -- I don't know if it works with older versions.

It expects the Open Babel 2.0 chemistry library (including headers) to be installed into
 /usr/local/lib which should be the default when you compile from source yourself or install from the ChemSpotlight package.

The main metadata importer code is in GetMetadataForFile.mm -- an Objective-C++ file. (It resembles fairly standard C++ code with the exception of some Apple CoreFoundation code to interface with Spotlight.)
